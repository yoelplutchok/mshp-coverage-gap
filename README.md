## Project Overview

This project analyzes the geographic distribution of the **Montefiore School Health Program (MSHP)** across Bronx public schools, identifying coverage gaps in neighborhoods with the highest childhood asthma burden and chronic absenteeism.

### Key Questions
1. Are schools WITHOUT MSHP coverage in higher-need neighborhoods?
2. Is there a relationship between MSHP coverage and chronic absenteeism?
3. Which schools should be prioritized for MSHP expansion?
4. What is the causal effect of MSHP on student outcomes?

---

## Key Findings

### Coverage Statistics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Bronx Schools | **370** |
| MSHP Covered | **84** (23%) |
| Not Covered | **286** (77%) |
| Tier 1 Priority Schools | **58** |

### Main Results

1. **MSHP targets high-need areas** 
   - Schools in highest-asthma neighborhoods (Hunts Point, Morrisania) have MSHP coverage
   - This reflects successful equity targeting by Montefiore

2. **No significant absenteeism difference**
   - MSHP mean: 38.99%
   - Non-MSHP mean: 38.45%
   - p-value: 0.70 (not significant)

3. **Dose-response trend**
   - Schools with longer MSHP exposure show lower absenteeism
   - r = -0.17 (suggestive but not significant)

4. **Coverage gaps exist**
   - Hunts Point - Mott Haven: Only 15% coverage despite highest asthma burden
   - 22 schools in "health deserts" (>1 mile from nearest MSHP)

## Methodology

### Priority Ranking Formula
Schools are ranked for MSHP expansion based on:

```
Priority Score = 0.25 × Asthma Burden +
                 0.25 × Social Vulnerability +
                 0.20 × Chronic Absenteeism +
                 0.15 × Geographic Isolation +
                 0.15 × Enrollment Size
```

### Causal Inference Methods
1. **Propensity Score Analysis** - Predicted probability of MSHP selection
2. **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)** - Adjusted for selection bias
3. **Stratification** - Effects within comparable school groups
4. **Dose-Response** - Years of MSHP exposure vs. outcomes

See [docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md) for full details.

## Limitations

1. **Cross-sectional data** - Cannot prove causation
2. **Ecological fallacy** - Health data is neighborhood-level, not school-level
3. **Selection bias** - MSHP placement is intentionally targeted to high-need areas
4. **Temporal mismatch** - Data sources from different years

See [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md) for full discussion.
